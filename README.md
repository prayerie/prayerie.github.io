Proof of concept theme editor + previewer for nitroustracker


renders tobkit widgets onto html canvases, quite cpu heavy and the layout is awful since i only made it for myself lol


usage - 


click a colour in the list and drag the picker to change it in realtime, or edit the theme text / paste a theme in and press "load" to load an existing theme


type a theme name (without '.nttheme') and export to file, blah blah blah
